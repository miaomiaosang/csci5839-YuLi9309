# Gesture Design

In today's class I design a new gesture to use spotify on Android phone.

When the users are in the interface of playlist, they can use one of their fingers to press on the slot of a song for a second, then the the song slot will float up and allow user to move the song in the playlist in the order they want. They can also choose to delete the song when the song is floating.
