# Usability

When designing a system on an auto-vending machine, we may not be able to consider enough details for the customers.  We may design a long process for them, but in the end the customers get lost in the process or they do not even know where to start. For example, today auto-vending machines with touch screens are very popular. However, some of those machines may have buttons as well. Looking at those buttons, the users may not be able to think that they should touch the screen to start, even the concept of touch screen interaction is very popular. Whatâ€™s more, blind people may not be able to use the touch screens. Even if we conduct heuristic evaluation, we may not be able to invite a blind people.

The system of train ticket auto vending can easily violate some of the rule of heuristics. For example, the rule of helping users to recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. Sometimes users may type in a location name, which is used by different cities in different states. The user may choose the incorrect state. However, they may realize this when they review all the ticket information in the paying stage. They may not find a place to correct this mistake and have to restart from the very beginning, which is frustrating.
