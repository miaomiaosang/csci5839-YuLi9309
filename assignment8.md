# Visual Design

From the chapter 4 of **Organization and Visual Structure**, I learned some basic idea about how to design the structure of an interface. What inspires me most is the sentence that said by Paul Klee: The eye travels along the paths cut out for it in the work. When we design, we design for people. Besides those rules that listed in the textbook, we need to think about how users use our designed interface.

The textbook lists 4 rules to keep in mind when design, they all follow the basic idea that designers should think about how human recognizes the interface structure. Structure ties elements in the interface together and navigates the user to browse the whole page. Structure in different should be kept in same style so that the user won’t be confused.

From the chapter of **arranging elements**, I learned that the structure of slide can express meaning. 

Creating slides is very different form creating other media materials because the author needs to present it to the audience. Slides are the minor role during presentation but it still need to help the presenter to express the contents, even emotion of the presenter. 

If I apply the idea in the chapter in the future presentation of my semester project, the medical reminder app for seniors, I would hope that user interface takes most of the space of my slides because my user interface is the think that I want to use to attract users and investments.

From the chapter of **Visual Salience and Finding Information**, I realize that when I write my document of how to use my semester project app, I should use some graphs to show the general function structure of my app. I should also make my content tidy and concise, so that my users won’t need to search for information for too long.
