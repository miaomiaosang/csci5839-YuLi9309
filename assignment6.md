# Prototyping rules and techniques

From this chapter I understand what is prototype, what is the process to make prototype.

This article addresses what is prototype very specifically. A prototype is a concrete form of our ideas. A prototype can give us a model that allow us to make more improvement and evaluate our ideas.  The process to make a prototype includes braining storming, consider the whole system horizontally and vertically, interact with the prototype, try to make improvements and ask users to evaluate it.

As for our product, the apple watch App designed for seniors to remind them to take medicine on time, applying this idea in construct our product can be very useful.  

First, when it came to our mind that we want to make an App that remind seniors to take medicine, we did some investigation on the current App market to see how similar Apps are made. We saw a lot of similar Apps and we did know how to make innovation on it. Now it seems that we should make a more precise representation of our ideas, maybe one with paper board and can be worn on wrist. I think in this way we can focus on details and figure out what improvements can we made, even a little one.

What inspires me most in this article is that we should make the prototype interactable so that we can make the using experience of our App more realistic.
