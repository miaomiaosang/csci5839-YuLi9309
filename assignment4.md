> In the Shadow of Misperception: Assistive Technology Use and Social Interactions

This paper mainly talks about what features that people with disabilities really want for technology. What I want to share from this passage is the viewpoints that people with disabilities made about technology, how to do interview to gather the ideas that people have for a certain topic as well as how to analysis the interview result.

The interview that the author gives to those interviewers is not very complicated, but it can help the author to picture the life of people with disabilities. They were asked about assistive technologies used, how technologies were used, and what they thought of their technologies. The analysis is very interesting, it gives the most valuable idea of the paper: what aspects should be paid attention to when design accessibility tools for them.

The paper mainly conveys an idea that what people with disability cares a lot is that whether they can live in the same way, with the same convenience just like those normal people. A scanner that can translate those paper-made book into audios can make blind people to access all the books that available to normal people. This is what people with disability like. On the other hand, an era bud with very strange design and color that help people who are weak in hearing may not be liked by users, because it marks the users with a sign of disability.

After reading this paper, except those tricks about how to do an interview and what should be considers when design for people with special needs, I think I also understand how to treat them. I should treat them in the way I treat all people without disabilities. Maybe I can give help when necessary, but I should keep in my mind that they do not want special help actually.

> Freedom to Roam: A Study of Mobile Device Adoption and Accessibility for People with Visual and Motor Disabilities

This paper pictures and analyzes the experience of people with disabilities using mobile devices. The authors used two ways to gather opinions of people with disabilities using mobile device such as iPhone and laptops.  For the interview, the authors designed questions such as how the interviewees acquired the devices, how the interviewees use the devices under different scenarios such as at home and outside home, how the interviewees want to improve the device an etc. The author also provides a new way to investigate the life of disabilities using mobile device: ask the participants to send a diary of using mobile device.

As a result, the authors find that even though there are specially-designed mobile devices for disabilities, the disabilities may not be willing to buy because they are expensive to afford. Instead, the participants developed special skills to adept to common devices on market, such as using lap to hold the phone, change the text font and size setting and etc.  

I believe that making disabilities to adapt to mobile devices with a lot of effort is not appropriate. There are a lot of people with disabilities, even old people can have difficulties using mobile devices. They also pay for the phones. The phones should be designed to adept their needs.  Maybe more functions and features should be designed for them on the software side so that the overall cost of mobile device won’t be increased too much and healthy people won’t be interrupted by the functions designed for disabilities.
