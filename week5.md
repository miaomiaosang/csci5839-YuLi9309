# Culture Probe & interview

## Mondy
-------------------
Today we talked about how to design a culture probe for our project.
Since the target users of our medical reminder products are seniors, we want to design some simple culture probe for them. So we decide to put give those seniors an old style camera which can print out the photo immediately after taken. We want the seniors to record their day, espiecially when they take medicine and get some kind of treatment. We also want them to record how they think and how they feel when taking those pictures. For some seniors who can use twitter, instead of taking pictures, we create some new twitter accounts for them to post twitters which is only visable by themselves. Then we log into their twitter accounts to see what they wrote.

Today we talked about how to do interview.

I interviewd my partner about his previous industry experience.

Me: what is the function of your previous job?

Partner: I was a back end engineer and I coded those network stuffes. 

Me: That sounds amazing, was your job like the content that we learn in the computer system class? Would you take that class?

Partner: Yes, they are very similar. But you know, the network system class is too easy for me. So I wouldn't take it.

Me: How long did you work as a back end engineer.

Partner: 4 years

Me: That's quite a long time. Will you work as a backend engineer in the future?

Partner: yes I will, I worked as a backend engineer last summer as an intern.

Me: wow, that sounds amazing. As a back end engineer who has worked a long time, do you have some advices for those begineers?

Partner: go take the network system class.
