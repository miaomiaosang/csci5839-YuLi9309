# Personas in interaction design

This chapter talks about the concept of personas in interaction design, including the reasons to set up personas and how to set up personas. This chapter also gives a case of professionals doing interaction design using personas.

Personas is a simple idea: develop a precise description of our user and what he wishes to accomplish. We made up persons, with their names, ages, professions and so on and design for them instead of a large crowd of people. For a broad audience have lots of description in some dimensions, it is very hard to figure a precise, ultimate goal for the audience. However, design for a made-up person can much easier because the description of such a person is clear and the broad audience can often tolerate some friction between their wish and the real products in market.

Making up personas for designing also makes communication between designers and programmers easier.  Debates between programmers and product managers are very common. Defining specific persona would help to stop arguments. With a broad definition and description of audience, one who want to make his claim more reasonable in the debate as long as he can make up a scenario. However, with a specific persona, no one can make up scenario randomly.

Making up personas can help to validate the design. The design team can constantly hold up the personas to see how well their design is. The persona is narrowly defined so that the reaction that a persona would have to use the products is very easy to speculate.

My group decide to design a smart watch for the elders. Besides some basic watch functions, we want this watch can satisfy some special needs of elders. For example, medicine time alerting, taking medicine encouragement, routing to home after lost their way and etc.  To establish our class project design, we have made up a few personas. They are:

- Jim, Male, 65, no family. Previous CTO of Macrohard before retiring. The medicine bottle easily disappears in his house. Early Alzheimer's, in an experimental medical group which do scientific research with JHU on how to cure Alzheimer’s with medicine.

- Maria, Female, 55, Arthritis: hearing problem. Live with her husband. Three married children working locally. Never used smart devices and computers in her life.

- Doctor Who, Male, 45, a doctor who has lots of experience on old people disease such as Alzheimer's and Arthritis. Doctor of Jim and Maria. Using Apple Watch.

- Nathan, 32, son of Maria. Loving his mother so much. Very busy at work.

These four personas are representations of the potential audience. We described them very precisely. The primary persona is Maria. Because her situation is very common among people in her age. 

These four personas helped us when we attempted to draw out some prototypes of our smart watch.

The alert shows automatically when need but the watch stays how a normal watch looks because our primary persona has never used smart device before. We don’t want to make something that force her to learn in her age.
