**1.This video is about 20 years old! Which ideas from this work show up in today's shopping carts? Which ideas did not make it, and why didn't they?**

Ideas from this work that show up in today's shopping cart:

1) The shopping carts use shopping baskets as containers.
2) wheels that can turn 90 degrees

Ideas from this work that did not show up in today's shopping cart and reason:

1) a portable scanner: 

  Reason: 1. By now, no one designed such a scanner and put it in the supermarkets. 2.Thefty often happens in supermarkets. The checkout process needs to be monitored. 3. What's more, the portable scanner can be stolen.
  
  However, there are some supermarkets that allow customers to scan their shopped commodities and check out by Apps on their phone. A employee would stand by the exit of the supermarket and do a final check on the recipt and commoditied that customers want to take out. I think this is quite low in efficiency.
  
  
2) baby chair that has a handle that keeps babies from falling from the cart(looks like the handel that roller coasters use)

Reason: not actually safe because babies can still fall off the cart when parents try to push the handle down. Children always struggle when their parents want to make them sit quietly.

**2.Who did the design team talk to? For each group of stakeholders that the designers talked to, explain why it was important to talk to them.**

The design team talked to the stuff of supermarkets and customers because they are the two groups of stakeholders that actually uses these shopping carts. Firstly, the ultimate goal of improving the design of shoping cart is to increase the working efficiency of stuff and shoping experience of customers, which can bring more profit to the supermarket. Secondly, the design team should not increase the costs of shopiing carts, such as cost to build the carts and maintaining the carts.
