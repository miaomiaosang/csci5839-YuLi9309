Culture Probes

I read two articles, they are:
1.	 Design: Cultural probes
2.	 Urban probes: encountering our emerging urban atmospheres

I think the ideas in these two articles can help me in my group project a lot because the audience of my project are seniors. There is large gap between me and those seniors from many aspects. I think these two articles are very helpful.

Design: Culture probes documented how the to learn the life and community of seniors and design for them. Instead of simply starting an awkward conversion with elders, the group in the article prepared a parcel of postcards, maps cameras and etc. to establish an implicit, long conversation with the elders. The items in the parcel are designed to start specific conversation such as the living and social environment of the community, which are important in community culture. 

When designing the culture probe, the team in the article viewed aesthetic and conceptual pleasure as a right rather than a luxury. They also applied conceptual arts: try to evoke and capture emotional ambience of different locations in the design of probe. This not only makes the “conversion” between the team and elders enjoyable, but also provoked the elders to consider their environment in a new way.

At last the team turned the probe to design.

In our group project, we want to get some chance to talk to local elders to understand their needs. Instead of just saying hello randomly in some communities that elders gather, we need to dive deeper into the social network of the community. We may apply to be volunteer in the community. We believe that we can get more information from the elders when we get familiar with them. 

Beside of talking to elders, I think my group can also invent some kind of culture probe. Considering our limited fund, I think we can distribute some post cards as well.

The last but not the least inspiration point the article gives me is how to treat elders. We should not treat them as needy and friendly. They are human and they have very complex humanities as well. They have deep feelings and desires. 

The second article I read is about how to set urban probes. I read it because I want to learn more about how to observe people’s life and community’s culture so that I can understand their needs well. The methodology introduced in the article to make an urban probe is useful. Before we formally design a unban probe, we need to observe the route that human take in the place we want to place the probe. Next, try to intervene with the environment. At last, design the probe, deploy it and observe people’s reaction to it.
