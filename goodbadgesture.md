## Good/Bad hand gestures

### Monday

### Good gestures

pinching to zoom

scrubbing video(up/down, control brightness/volumes)

two fingers swipe back

swipe to delete

My teamates think that, when using a cell phone, one-hand gestures are always better than two-hand gestures because users always need one of their hands to hold the phone.

### Bad gesture

Double tap (counter intuitive)

can't remap (frequency)

Four finger swipe(feedback, size difference)

Wake fitbit(unintentional activations, rude af, unambiguous what people are doing)

### Wednesday

### Evaluating gesture

1. painful? physically capable? contextual ability (are you holding something)? intuitive? explainable? false positive rate.
