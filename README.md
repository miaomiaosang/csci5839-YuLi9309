#Reading Assignment 1: IDEO & deep dive
========================================

1.This video is about 20 years old! Which ideas from this work show up in today's shopping carts? Which ideas did not make it, and why didn't they?

Ideas from this work that show up in today's shopping cart:
1) The shopping carts use shopping baskets as containers.
2) wheels that can turn 90 degrees

Ideas from this work that did not show up in today's shopping cart and reason:
1) a portable scanner: 
  Reason: Thefty often happens in supermarkets. The checkout process needs to be monitored. What's more, the portable scanner can be stolen.
  However, there are some supermarkets that allow customers to scan their shopped commodities and check out by Apps on their phone. A employee would stand by the exit of the supermarket and do a final check on the recipt and commoditied that customers want to take out. I think this is quite low in efficiency.
