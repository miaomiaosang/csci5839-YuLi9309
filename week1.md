# Discussion around how people hate Apple TV remote and how the design of Apple TV remote can be improved

### Defects of Apple TV remote that people hate:

1. size too small
2. functions too simple
3. functions can be mergerd into iphones. SO the remote is kind of redundant.
4. dark color, easy to get lost when light is off

### Solutions we came up with
1. shape
2. more weight toward bottom
3. buttons light up
4. pairing nearby device to merge its function to other devices such as ipone.
