## Something frustrating to use and something pleasing to use
1. pleasing to use: Notability in ipad,

  - replaces my pens and notebooks
  
  - provides many kinds of writing and painting patterns
  
  - can easily serch for something that I wrote by hand for this app recognizes hand writting
  
2. frustrating to use: washing machine

  - it shakes heavily when spin to dry and make the whole wooden structure building shaking. Why doesn't choose a gentle way to dry cloth such as by blowing hot wind and spin gentlely?

## Discussion around how people hate Apple TV remote and how the design of Apple TV remote can be improved

### Defects of Apple TV remote that people hate:

1. size too small
2. functions too simple
3. functions can be mergerd into iphones. SO the remote is kind of redundant.
4. dark color, easy to get lost when light is off

### Solutions we came up with
1. shape
2. more weight toward bottom
3. buttons light up
4. pairing nearby device to merge its function to other devices such as ipone.
